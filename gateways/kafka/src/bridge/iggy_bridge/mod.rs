/// Passes attempted, after the first, before [`IggyBridge::connect`] gives up and returns `Err`.
///
/// Not the SDK's own default (`TcpClientReconnectionConfig::default()` is `max_retries: None` -
/// unlimited, one dial per second, forever). A Kafka client already retries at the wire-protocol
/// level once a handler maps a bridge failure to a retriable error code; the bridge blocking a
/// request task inside an unbounded internal reconnect loop would just add a second, invisible
/// retry layer underneath that one instead of surfacing the failure so the mapped code can be
/// sent.
///
/// This bounds the *count*, not the *wall-clock time*, of that inner retry loop - see
/// [`REQUEST_TIMEOUT`] for the latter.
const RECONNECTION_RETRIES: u32 = 3;

/// Wall-clock ceiling [`with_request_timeout`] applies uniformly: to the initial `client.connect()`
/// in [`IggyBridge::connect`] (including every attempt [`RECONNECTION_RETRIES`] makes internally),
/// and to every call made after it succeeds (`get_stream`, `create_stream`, `get_topic`,
/// `create_topic`, `shutdown`).
///
/// One constant, not two separately-named ones with the same value: both call sites bound the
/// identical underlying hazard. `TcpClient::establish_bounded` only applies its own
/// `FAILOVER_DIAL_TIMEOUT` (2s) when at least two failover candidates are configured
/// (`tcp_client.rs`) - a bridge always configures exactly one address, so that guard never engages
/// at either site, and the plain `TcpStream::connect` underneath has no deadline of its own.
/// Against a firewall that drops SYN packets instead of refusing them, each dial attempt pays the
/// kernel's own SYN-retry timeout (minutes, not seconds) rather than the `reconnection_interval`
/// between attempts - a closed port (instant RST) never exercises this path, so the failure mode
/// only shows up in production. 15s comfortably covers a slow-but-alive server's handshake (well
/// above p99 login latency) while still failing well short of the pathological multi-minute case.
///
/// Known limitation, not closed by this constant: [`with_request_timeout`] cancels only the
/// *caller's* wait, not the SDK's own work. `TcpClient::send_raw_vsr_attempt` (`tcp_client.rs`)
/// writes, flushes and reads inside a detached `tokio::spawn` specifically so that dropping the
/// awaiting future - exactly what this timeout does on expiry - cannot abort it mid-flight (that
/// function's own "SAFETY: we run code holding the `stream` lock in a task so we can't be
/// cancelled while holding the lock"). A call that times out here can leave that detached task
/// still holding `IggyClient`'s single stream mutex for up to `RESPONSE_READ_TIMEOUT` (30s,
/// `tcp_client.rs`) longer, queuing every other bridge call behind it. Raising this constant does
/// not close the gap either: a mid-call reconnect (`send_raw_with_response`, `tcp_client.rs`)
/// replays on a fresh `RESPONSE_READ_TIMEOUT` budget, and the reconnect dial itself goes through
/// the same undead-lined `TcpStream::connect` this constant exists to bound - genuinely unbounded,
/// so no finite value here can guarantee catching it. That same unboundedness is why this timeout
/// cannot simply be dropped for post-connect calls either: [`IggyBridge`] holds one `IggyClient`
/// with no pooling, so an unbounded reconnect dial with nothing here to stop it would wedge every
/// later call on this bridge, not just the one that triggered it. No longer a hypothetical: since
/// `ListOffsets` (#3537) this bridge is called from a live Kafka handler, with no semaphore
/// bounding concurrent bridge calls. Closing the underlying gap needs either a cooperatively
/// cancellable SDK call or a deadline on the SDK's own reconnect dial, neither of which this
/// bridge can add from the outside; bounding concurrent bridge calls is a separate, addressable
/// fix that becomes more pressing as `CreateTopics` and `Metadata` (#3538/#3534) add more live
/// callers.
const REQUEST_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(15);

/// Wraps a single Iggy client call in [`REQUEST_TIMEOUT`]. See that constant's doc for why every
/// bridge method needs this, not just [`IggyBridge::connect`] - and for the cancellation gap this
/// wrapper does not close.
///
/// On expiry, maps to [`BridgeError::Timeout`], not `IggyError::CannotEstablishConnection`: the
/// SDK's write/read run in a detached task this timeout cannot abort (see [`REQUEST_TIMEOUT`]'s
/// doc), so by the time this fires the request may already be on the wire, or already applied
/// server-side - a genuinely unknown outcome, not a known connection failure. `BridgeError`'s own
/// mapping already treats an unknown outcome (`IggyError::TransientNotCommitted`) as distinct from
/// a known-safe-to-retry one for exactly this reason; a caller-side timeout is the same shape and
/// must not borrow the known-safe code.
