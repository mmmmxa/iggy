# Kafka to Iggy record mapping

Status: proposed. Direction agreed with @spetz and @hubcio on 2026-09-16 ("messages should be
stored in iggy format"); the escape hatches below still need sign-off. Closes the last open
scope item of [#3533](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3533) and blocks
[#3535](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3535) (Produce) and
[#3536](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3536) (Fetch).

## Decision

One Kafka record becomes one Iggy message, in Iggy's own format: the record value is the
message payload, the key and the Kafka headers become Iggy user headers. The gateway rebuilds
a Kafka record batch on Fetch.

Two properties drive this.

A Kafka consumer must be able to read a topic an Iggy producer wrote. This is the staged
migration the maintainers described: rewrite producers to the Iggy SDK first, leave consumers
on the gateway until later. The gateway can only encode an arbitrary Iggy message as a Kafka
record if the stored form has no Kafka framing in it.

Kafka offsets must line up with Iggy offsets. A Kafka record batch carries N records under one
base offset, while an Iggy message consumes exactly one offset. Storing a batch whole makes
every offset the gateway reports wrong by the batch size, and fixing that inside Iggy means
teaching the server to count records inside an opaque payload.

Storing the Kafka payload and headers as a dump inside the Iggy payload was the alternative
raised in the same thread. It does not satisfy the first property on its own: the gateway would
still need a native path for Iggy-written messages, so it would carry two storage formats
instead of one. Native storage with a narrow fallback (see below) keeps that to one.

## Field mapping

Produce, per record:

| Kafka | Iggy |
| ------- | ------ |
| (nothing) | `kafka.v` user header, one byte, the mapping version |
| record value | `payload` |
| record key | `kafka.key` user header, `Raw` |
| record header `name` | `kafka.h.<name>` user header, `Raw` |
| record timestamp (CreateTime), milliseconds | `origin_timestamp`, microseconds |
| record offset | partition offset, assigned by Iggy |
| partition index | partition index, both 0-based |
| topic | stream and topic per `TopicMapping` |

Fetch reverses it. A message with no `kafka.v` header is a message an Iggy client wrote. It
encodes as a Kafka record with a null key, and its Iggy user headers become Kafka headers under
their own names. The record timestamp comes from `origin_timestamp`. If the origin timestamp is zero, it comes
from the server-assigned `timestamp` instead.

An Iggy header key carries a kind as well as bytes. If the bytes are UTF-8, they are the Kafka
header name, whatever the kind says. The kind is the producer's choice, and a Kafka name is a
string either way. Iggy header values are emitted as their raw bytes.

### Provenance

`kafka.v` is on every message the gateway writes and on no other. Fetch reads it first, and
everything else in this document follows from what it says.

Present and equal to the version this build implements: the gateway wrote this message. Every
marker on it is authoritative, and a marker this build does not recognize is an error rather than
a guess. Only `kafka.h.` headers reach the consumer as Kafka headers.

Present and some other value: a later mapping wrote this message. Fetch refuses it rather than
reading it under rules that changed after it was written.

Absent: an Iggy client wrote this message. No `kafka.` header on it means anything, every header
passes through under its own name, and the payload is the record value.

The alternative was to take any `kafka.`-prefixed header as proof of provenance. This document
reserves the namespace and nothing in the server enforces it, so that proof was worthless. One
stray `kafka.` header hid every other header on a message, and a `kafka.value` of `null` turned
the message into a tombstone. One version header costs about 14 bytes against the 100 KB header
budget and settles all of it.

The native path is versioned for a second reason. It is the storage form for nearly every record,
and open questions 2 and 3 below can still change it. Without a version on the stored message, a
change to either one decodes older records wrongly and gives no way to notice.

What `kafka.v` does not give is enforcement. It is a claim the message makes. The server keeps no
namespace for it, so an Iggy writer can set `kafka.v` to a version no build implements. Every read
of that message then fails. Fetch cannot serve a record it cannot decode, and a Kafka consumer
cannot step over one. One such message therefore stalls the partition for every Kafka consumer.

This is the open end of the provenance design, and it belongs to Fetch rather than to the mapping.
The handler in [#3536](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3536) owns the policy for a message
the mapping refuses. Two shapes are on the table. Skipping serves the records around it and
leaves a gap, which Kafka consumers already tolerate on a compacted topic. Its cost is that a
message goes missing with no signal. Quarantining records the offset and surfaces a metric. Its
cost is somewhere to keep the record. Neither is decided here.

### Timestamps

Kafka carries a record timestamp in milliseconds. Iggy carries `origin_timestamp` in
microseconds (`core/common/src/types/message/iggy_message.rs:191`). Produce multiplies by 1000.
Fetch divides by 1000 and truncates toward zero.

A record that arrived through Produce survives the round trip exactly, because its microsecond
value is always a whole number of milliseconds. A message an Iggy client wrote does not. Its
sub-millisecond digits are lost on the way out, and Kafka has no field to keep them in.

Kafka sends `-1` for a record with no timestamp. That is stored as `0`, and Fetch already reads
a zero origin timestamp as an instruction to use the server-assigned timestamp instead. A real
broker does the same thing under `LogAppendTime`, so the two agree.

A record stamped at exactly `0` ms, the Unix epoch, is a different record that stores the same
`0`. It carries a `kafka.ts` header holding `epoch` to say so, and Fetch reads that header before
it reads the origin timestamp. Without it a producer that stamps a record `0` gets the server's
clock back instead, and never learns that the value changed.

One Iggy batch holds timestamps that span at most `MAX_TIMESTAMP_DELTA_MICROS`, which is
`u32::MAX` microseconds, about 71.6 minutes (`core/binary_protocol/src/batch.rs:55`). The send
encoder stores each message as a `u32` delta from the batch minimum and refuses a larger one
(`core/binary_protocol/src/requests/messages/send_messages.rs:133`). Kafka puts no such bound on
one produce batch, so two shapes fail:

- a batch whose CreateTime values span more than 71.6 minutes, which replay and mirror producers
  reach
- a batch that mixes a record with no timestamp, stored as `0`, with normally stamped records

Neither is fixable in the record mapping, which sees one record and has no batch minimum to work
from. Produce ([#3535](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3535)) owns splitting a produce
batch into sends the server accepts.

## Records Iggy cannot hold natively

Iggy rejects an empty payload (`core/common/src/types/message/iggy_message.rs:169`), caps a
user header value at 255 bytes (`core/common/src/types/message/user_headers.rs:631`), keys
headers in a `BTreeMap` so a name cannot repeat, and caps all user headers of one message at
100 KB (`MAX_USER_HEADERS_SIZE`, `iggy_message.rs:58`). Kafka allows all of the shapes those
rules exclude, so two mechanisms cover them.

None of those four numbers is a gateway setting. They are fixed constants on the server's
message type, with no configuration knob and no recorded rationale. The header budget works out
to roughly 350 headers at the 255-byte value cap, so in practice the key-length rule below is
what sends a record into the fallback and the budget is not.

### Null and empty values

A record with a null value (a tombstone) or a zero-length value is stored with a single `0x00`
byte payload and a `kafka.value` header holding `null` or `empty`. Fetch reads that header and
restores the original, discarding the placeholder byte.

This keeps tombstones on the fast path rather than pushing them into the fallback, because they
are ordinary traffic on compacted Kafka topics. Iggy has no compaction, so a tombstone is stored
and served like any other record and nothing acts on it.

### Everything else: the envelope fallback

A record takes the fallback when any of these hold:

- the key is present and zero-length, which is not the same as a null key. Iggy rejects an
  empty header value on the same rule that caps it at 255 bytes, so `kafka.key` cannot carry it
- the key is longer than 255 bytes
- a header name, prefixed with `kafka.h.`, is longer than 255 bytes
- a header value is null, empty, or longer than 255 bytes
- the headers together would exceed the 100 KB user-header budget

A repeated header name belonged on that list and is not reachable. Kafka allows one, but
`kafka_protocol` decodes headers into an `IndexMap` and inserts each in turn (`records.rs:919`),
so a repeat overwrites its earlier entry before any gateway code runs. The last value wins and
the record takes the native path. Catching the case needs a decoder this gateway does not have.

Such a record is stored with a `kafka.envelope` header whose value is one byte, the byte layout
version, currently `1`. The payload holds the key, the value and the headers in the layout below.
Fetch checks for that header first and takes the plain path only when it is absent.

That byte numbers the layout below and nothing else. `kafka.v` numbers the mapping as a whole.
Both exist because the envelope layout can change while the rest of the mapping stands. A record
on the native path also needs a version, and it has no envelope to carry one.

The layout is fixed here rather than left to the implementation, because `kafka_protocol` hands
a handler a decoded `Record` and never a raw slice of the record, so there is no verbatim body
to copy. All integers are little-endian.

```text
u8   flags           bit 0 key present, bit 1 value present
u32  key_len         0 when the key is absent
..   key
u32  value_len       0 when the value is absent
..   value
u32  header_count
     repeated header_count times:
       u32  name_len
       ..   name
       u8   value_present
       u32  value_len   0 when the header value is absent
       ..   value
```

That is 13 bytes of fixed overhead plus 9 bytes per header. Re-encoding the record as a
one-record Kafka batch would also work and would cost less code, but it puts batch framing back
into storage, which is the thing this document decided against.

The cost is that these messages are opaque to Iggy consumers and connectors. That is the point
of confining the fallback to record shapes that are rare in practice, rather than making it the
default storage form.

The envelope moves the key and the headers into the payload, so it cannot hold every record the
native path cannot. A value close enough to `MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE`, on a record whose key is empty or
over 255 bytes, comes to more than `MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE` once the envelope wraps it, and Produce
rejects the record with `MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE` (10). The gateway measures the envelope before it
builds one, so the answer does not depend on allocating a payload already known to be too big.

## Batch-level fields

Per-record storage drops what the Kafka record batch header carries: producer id, producer
epoch, base sequence, the transactional flag, compression and the batch CRC. Fetch synthesizes
a batch with producer id `-1`, epoch `-1`, base sequence `-1`, no compression, `CreateTime`
timestamps, and a recomputed CRC32C.

Two consequences worth stating before they surprise someone:

- Idempotent-producer deduplication cannot be reconstructed from stored data later. If
  [#3545](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3545) ever grows past a stub, producer id,
  epoch and sequence need their own tracking.
- The bytes a consumer receives are not the bytes the producer sent, so anything comparing
  batches byte for byte across the gateway will differ.

Whether producer id `-1` is what Fetch actually sends depends on the InitProducerId decision in
[`IDEMPOTENCE.md`](IDEMPOTENCE.md). Allocating producer ids does not change what is stored, only
what Produce accepts, so this section holds under either answer.

Produce refuses a control batch and a transactional batch. A stored message carries neither flag.
A control record admitted here therefore reaches consumers as ordinary application data, and a
consumer filters control records by exactly that flag. Transactions are out of scope in
[`IDEMPOTENCE.md`](IDEMPOTENCE.md), so refusing is the answer that leaves a consumer's view
intact.

Fetch writes one batch per response rather than one per record. The encoder groups records while
`offset - sequence` holds, so each record's `sequence` is numbered from the first offset in the
response. The record constructor leaves `sequence` at `-1` on every record. That breaks the group
on every record, and each one then carries its own 61-byte batch header.

Two counts in a batch drive an allocation, and upstream checks each one for sign alone. Both are
bounded here, in different places, because no single place can see them both.

The batch header's record count sits in the header, and `RecordBatchDecoder` reserves a `Vec` from
it (`kafka-protocol-0.18.0/src/records.rs:517`). A 61-byte batch declaring `i32::MAX` records asks
for 377 GB. Produce reads every batch header before it decodes a record and refuses a count the
blob cannot produce. That ceiling is the blob's own length. If something in the blob is
compressed, the decompression budget is added to it. An uncompressed batch's records are already
in the blob, and granting it the budget as well lets a 70-byte batch declare a million records.

The per-record header count sits inside a record body, as a varint, so no batch header reports it
and the header pass cannot see it. `Record::decode_new` reserves an `IndexMap` from it
(`kafka-protocol-0.18.0/src/records.rs:896`), and that allocation is resident rather than virtual,
because hashbrown writes its control bytes. A 72-byte batch declaring one record and `i32::MAX`
headers aborts the process. Produce therefore walks the record bytes in the decompression step,
which runs for every batch including an uncompressed one. It refuses a header count the record's
own bytes cannot hold, at two length varints per header.

Neither bound changes the ratio between a minimal wire record and a decoded `Record`. A
legitimate request of small records pays that ratio too.

Produce decompresses gzip, snappy, lz4 and zstd batches. `gateways/kafka/Cargo.toml` turns those
four features on for `kafka-protocol` and the workspace entry stays on `broker` alone, so the
codecs are declared by the crate that needs them. Fetch emits uncompressed batches.

Decompression needs its own bound, and the bound is per request rather than per batch.
`max_frame_size` bounds the frame a client sent, which is the compressed size, and zstd reaches
1000 to 1 on repetitive input without being asked, so an 8 MiB frame can expand to gigabytes. One
frame also carries many batches: the request holds up to `MAX_REQUEST_ELEMENTS` (4096) topic and
partition entries, each with its own records blob. A cap applied to one batch at a time would
therefore still admit 4096 times that much output.

Produce keeps a single decompression budget for the whole request, set to `max_frame_size`, so a
compressed request can never yield more than the same client could have sent uncompressed. A
batch that exhausts the budget is rejected with `MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE` (10). Each decompressed
record value has to clear Iggy's own `MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE` (64 MB, `iggy_message.rs:44`) separately,
since one record becomes one message.

The budget bounds the peak, not just the total. `kafka_protocol`'s own decompressors write the
whole stream into a growing buffer before they hand it over (`compression/gzip.rs:46` and its
three siblings). A batch decoded through them reaches its full decompressed size in memory, and
the budget then reports an overrun that already happened.

The gateway therefore drives the four codecs itself, through an `io::Write` sink that refuses the
write past the budget. Gzip, zstd and lz4 stream through that sink. Snappy is the one codec that
states its output size up front, and `snap` reads that number without allocating. The declared
size is charged before the decoder runs, for Kafka's own block framing and for raw snappy alike.

`records::decode_batches` decompresses, and `records::DecompressionBudget` is the bound. The
budget is a parameter, so setting it to `max_frame_size` for the whole request belongs to the
Produce handler in [#3535](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3535). Until that lands, nothing
calls either one in a server path.

## Offsets

Kafka offset and Iggy offset are the same number for the same record, and both partition spaces
are 0-based, so neither direction converts.

Produce takes the base offset from the send confirmation
(`SendMessagesConfirmationResponse::base_offset`). The server may return no confirmation, for
example for a request it classifies as a duplicate, in which case the response carries `-1`
rather than a guessed offset; Kafka clients surface that as an unknown offset.

ListOffsets LATEST is the high watermark from `IggyBridge::high_watermarks`. EARLIEST has no
server-side field today (`Partition` carries no log start offset), so it reads the first
retained message instead, and the `(messages_count, current_offset) == (0, 0)` ambiguity
documented on `high_watermarks` applies to both.

### Header order

Kafka carries record headers as an ordered list. Iggy keys them in a `BTreeMap`, so Fetch emits
them sorted by name and the producer's order is gone.

There is no fallback for this, because the gateway cannot tell whether a record's header order
carries meaning. The envelope does preserve order, since it stores the headers as a list, but a
record only reaches the envelope for one of the reasons above. A consumer that depends on header
order therefore sees a different order through the gateway than a real broker would give it.

### Header name collisions

An Iggy header key is bytes plus a kind, and the key orders on kind before bytes
(`core/common/src/types/message/user_headers.rs:209`). Two keys holding the same bytes under
different kinds are therefore two stored headers. A Kafka header name is a string, so both map to
one name.

Kafka carries headers as a list and holds both. A `kafka_protocol` `Record` keys them in an
`IndexMap`, so nothing here keeps the pair, and the later key in stored order wins.

On a message the gateway wrote this cannot happen, because `to_iggy` writes one key kind. Fetch
therefore refuses such a message, rather than dropping a header from it quietly. On a message an
Iggy client wrote it can happen, and Fetch keeps one header and loses the other. Refusing that
message lets one Iggy writer stall the partition for every Kafka consumer of it, which is the
worse of the two.

## Partitioning

Both systems number partitions from 0, so the partition index passes through unchanged in each
direction and neither side converts.

Produce sends to the partition the request names, `Partitioning::partition_id(index)`. A Kafka
producer resolves the partition itself before it builds the request, so every partition index in
a `ProduceRequest` is a real one and `Partitioning::balanced()` has no trigger on this path. The
`-1` that `SCOPE.md` refers to belongs to CreateTopics, where it means "use the broker default
partition count", and it is handled there rather than here.

Kafka consumer groups are not mapped onto Iggy consumer groups. The gateway assigns partitions
to group members the way Kafka does, in the client, and polls every partition by explicit offset.
Iggy's group registry is used as an offset key and for nothing else, which
[`OFFSET_STORAGE.md`](OFFSET_STORAGE.md) covers.

## Reserved header namespace

`kafka.` is reserved on messages the gateway writes. Nothing in the server enforces it, so the
reservation buys nothing on its own. `kafka.v` carries the provenance instead, as the Provenance
section above describes. An Iggy producer that sets `kafka.value` or `kafka.envelope` without
`kafka.v` gets those headers back under their own names. The gateway reads none of them as
metadata.

A producer that sets `kafka.v` as well is claiming to be this gateway, and Fetch takes the claim:
a marker or an envelope that does not parse is then an error for that message. The header block
and the envelope payload are still treated as untrusted throughout, so the error is a rejection
and never an allocation. The envelope decoder charges the nine bytes each header needs against
the payload before it reserves for one, and it rejects a payload with bytes left over after the
last header.

One more case is not a namespace question. Iggy folds a user-header block it cannot parse into
"this message has no headers" (`core/common/src/types/message/iggy_message.rs:240`). Read that
way, an enveloped message loses its `kafka.envelope` marker. Its envelope bytes then reach the
consumer as the record value, and a tombstone arrives as a one-byte message. Fetch tells an
unreadable block from an absent one by the stored `user_headers_length`, and refuses the
message.

## Open questions

Four questions need an answer before Produce ([#3535](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3535))
is written. Each one carries a default. If no answer lands by 2026-09-22, the default is taken,
this document is updated to record that it was decided by default, and the work proceeds.

### 1. Envelope fallback, or reject the record?

A record that Iggy cannot hold natively goes into the envelope described above. The alternative
is to reject it with `MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE` (10), so that nothing an Iggy consumer cannot read ever
reaches a stream.

Rejecting is the stricter guarantee and the worse compatibility story: a Kafka producer that
sends a 300-byte key works against a real broker and fails against the gateway.

Default: keep the envelope.

### 2. Is `kafka.` the right prefix?

Every Kafka header name is stored as `kafka.h.<name>`, which spends 8 of the 255 bytes an Iggy
header name has, on every header of every record. A shorter prefix buys those bytes back and
costs readability for anyone reading a stream by hand.

Default: keep `kafka.`. `kafka.v` makes the answer revisable: a later mapping version can use a
shorter prefix, and already stored records keep decoding under the version they carry.

### 3. Is the placeholder byte acceptable for tombstones?

A null or empty value is stored as one `0x00` byte plus a `kafka.value` marker header. The
payload a native Iggy consumer sees is therefore a byte the producer never sent.

The alternative is the envelope, which costs a tombstone the fast path. Tombstones are ordinary
traffic on compacted Kafka topics, and Iggy has no compaction, so they are stored and served
like any other record.

Default: keep the placeholder byte. `kafka.v` makes this answer revisable too, on the same
terms as question 2.

### 4. Recompress on Fetch, or always emit uncompressed?

Produce decompresses, and Fetch currently rebuilds an uncompressed batch. Recompressing per
topic costs CPU on the read path and saves bytes on the wire to the consumer.

Default: always emit uncompressed, and revisit when a benchmark says it matters.

### Not asked here

A Kafka `retention.ms` topic config could map onto Iggy's `message_expiry` at creation time.
`ensure_stream_and_topic` leaves topics on the server default, which never expires. That belongs
to CreateTopics ([#3538](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3538)), which owns topic
configuration, rather than to the record mapping.
