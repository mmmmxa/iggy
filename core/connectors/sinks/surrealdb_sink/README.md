# SurrealDB Sink Connector

Writes Apache Iggy stream messages into SurrealDB over the HTTP API.

The sink splits each poll into chunks of at most `batch_size` messages and writes
one SurrealQL bulk `INSERT IGNORE ... RETURN NONE` per chunk containing valid
records. Each record uses a deterministic SurrealDB record id derived from
stream, topic, partition, offset and Iggy message id. Replaying those identities
leaves existing records and their payloads untouched. There is no cross-poll buffer.

The runtime auto-commits while polling, logs/counts failed plugin callbacks, and
continues without replaying them. Deterministic IDs protect repeated writes of
the same identities, but do not ensure that a failed batch will be delivered.

## Configuration

From the matching Iggy checkout root, build the plugin:

```bash
cargo build --release -p iggy_connector_surrealdb_sink
```

Use the [sink guide](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/connectors/sinks/sink/) for the
broker credentials and main runtime configuration. Save this connector entry in
its connector directory and start the runtime from the checkout root. The
[SurrealDB walkthrough](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/connectors/sinks/surrealdb/)
includes local backend, Iggy CLI and SQL query commands.

### Plugin Fields

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | required | SurrealDB HTTP host and port without scheme, for example `127.0.0.1:8000`. Full `http://` or `https://` URLs are also accepted. |
| `namespace` | required | SurrealDB namespace selected during `open()`. |
| `database` | required | SurrealDB database selected during `open()`. |
| `table` | required | Target table. Must be a safe SurrealQL identifier. |
| `username` / `password` | none | Both required unless `auth_scope = "none"`. |
| `auth_scope` | `root` | `root`, `namespace`, `database`, or `none`. |
| `use_tls` | `false` | Uses `https://` when true and `endpoint` has no scheme, `http://` otherwise. |
| `auto_define_table` | `false` | Creates missing namespace/database and a schemaless table; requires root authentication scope. |
| `define_indexes` | `false` | Defines a non-unique stream/topic/partition/offset index; requires metadata and only runs with automatic DDL. |
| `batch_size` | `1000` | Maximum input records per insert chunk; zero is raised to one. |
| `payload_format` | `auto` | `auto`, `json`, `text`, `base64`, or `binary` (`binary` is an alias for `base64`). |
| `include_metadata` | `true` | Stores stream/topic/partition/offset/timestamp/schema fields. |
| `include_headers` | `true` | Stores Iggy headers as a deterministic object. Raw headers are base64 encoded. |
| `include_checksum` | `true` | Stores `iggy_checksum`. |
| `include_origin_timestamp` | `true` | Stores `iggy_origin_timestamp`. |
| `query_timeout` | `30s` | Timeout per HTTP request, not a total retry/reconnect budget. |
| `max_retries` | `3` | Total attempts for transient write failures. Values below `1` are raised to `1`. |
| `retry_delay` | `100ms` | Base retry delay. |
| `max_retry_delay` | `5s` | Capped exponential retry delay. |
| `verbose_logging` | `false` | Emits per-batch success logs at `info`. |

Namespace, database and table names must start with an ASCII letter or underscore
and contain only ASCII letters, digits and underscores. Endpoints reject embedded
credentials, paths beyond `/`, query strings and fragments. An explicit HTTP(S)
scheme takes precedence over `use_tls`. Authentication-scope and payload-format
names are case-insensitive; unknown values reject startup.

Root/namespace/database authentication requires both credentials. Startup checks
`/signin`; subsequent SQL uses Basic authentication with the configured scope.
Namespace/database users require pre-existing resources and automatic DDL disabled.
`auth_scope = "none"` ignores credentials and requires a server that permits the
unauthenticated operations. Automatic DDL uses `IF NOT EXISTS` and does not
migrate existing definitions. Index creation uses `<table>_iggy_offset_idx`.
Disabling metadata with indexes enabled rejects startup; disabling automatic DDL
with indexes enabled logs a warning and skips index creation.

Invalid duration strings warn and fall back to `1s`; zero is accepted. A maximum
retry delay smaller than the base delay is raised to the base delay.

## Stored Shape

Every submitted record contains:

- `id`: deterministic SurrealDB record id key
- `iggy_message_id`: original Iggy message id as a string
- `payload`
- `payload_encoding`

`include_metadata` adds `iggy_stream`, `iggy_topic`, `iggy_partition_id`,
`iggy_offset`, `iggy_timestamp` and `iggy_schema`. `iggy_schema` records the
payload variant the connector received, not the stream's configured `schema`:
an `avro` stream writes `json`, because the Avro decoder extracts to JSON by
default, and `flat_buffer` and `proto` streams do the same. Rows written before
this change recorded the configured schema, so historical rows on those streams
disagree with new ones. The checksum, origin timestamp
and headers have independent inclusion flags. `iggy_headers` is omitted when
headers are absent or empty. Non-raw headers are strings, including numeric and
boolean values; raw headers use `{"data":"AQID","iggy_header_encoding":"base64"}`.

Partition IDs, offsets, timestamps and checksums are strings. Timestamps retain
Iggy's microsecond values. Record keys encode stream/topic UTF-8 bytes as hex,
then partition, offset and the 32-digit hexadecimal message ID. Payload and
transform changes do not alter that identity.

`payload_format = "auto"` stores decoded JSON payloads as queryable SurrealDB
values, text variants as strings, Proto variants as the JSON document they
hold when the text parses as JSON or as strings otherwise, and
raw/Avro/FlatBuffer bytes as base64
strings, even when raw bytes contain valid JSON. Explicit `json` parses other
payload variants as JSON, `text` requires UTF-8, and `base64`/`binary` encodes the
payload bytes. Invalid conversions reject that record. Destination schema,
numeric and other value constraints still apply.

The sink's `messages_processed` counter counts records submitted in successful
SQL statements, including ignored records. On SurrealDB 3.1.4, `INSERT IGNORE`
also silently skips unique-index conflicts and field-assertion failures while
accepting valid records from the same chunk. Runtime counters instead reflect
whether the whole callback succeeded. Neither counts newly inserted rows.

## Failures and Retries

Malformed records are skipped while valid records in the same chunk are still
submitted. A failed chunk does not stop later chunks; the last error is returned.
HTTP status and every SQL statement status are checked. Successful chunks are not
rolled back when another chunk fails.

The sink retries transaction-conflict errors, connection/timeouts and HTTP 408,
429, 500, 502, 503 and 504, using capped exponential backoff with jitter.
`Retry-After` is not used. Connection errors trigger reconnection and repeat
sign-in, health and optional DDL; failed reconnection stops that chunk.
Deterministic `INSERT IGNORE` IDs preserve existing records but provide no
end-to-end at-least-once delivery guarantee.
